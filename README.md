Taxi Park

The TaxiPark class stores information about registered drivers, passengers, and their trips. Your task is to implement six functions which collect different statistics about the data.

SubTask 1

Set<Driver> findFakeDrivers() Find all the drivers who didn't perform any trips.

SubTask 2

Set<Passenger> findFaithfulPassengers(int minTrips) Find all the clients who completed at least the given number of trips.

SubTask3

Set<Passenger> FrequentPassengers(driver: Driver) Find all the passengers who were driven by a certain driver more than once.

SubTask4

Set<Passenger> findSmartPassengers() If we consider "smart", a passenger who had a discount for the majority of the 
trips they made or took part in (including the trips with more than one passenger), find all the "smart" passengers. 
A "smart" passenger should have strictly more trips with discount than trips without discount, the equal amounts of 
trips with and without discount isn't enough.

SubTask5

Set<Passenger> findTheMostFrequentTripDurationPeriod(): Find the most frequent trip duration period among 
minute periods 0..9, 10..19, 20..29, and so on. Return any suitable period if many are the most frequent, return null 
if there're no trips.

SubTask 6

Boolean checkParetoPrinciple() Check whether no more than 20% of the drivers contribute 80% of the income. 
The function should return true if the top 20% drivers (meaning the top 20% best performers) represent 80% or more of 
all trips total income, or false if not. The drivers that have no trips should be considered as contributing zero 
income. If the taxi park contains no trips, the result should be false.

For example, if there're 39 drivers in the taxi park, we need to check that no more than 20% of the most successful 
ones, which is seven drivers (39 * 0.2 = 7.8), contribute at least 80% of the total income. Note that eight drivers 
out of 39 is 20.51% which is more than 20%, so we check the income of seven the most successful drivers.
